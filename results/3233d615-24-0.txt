Human_Prompt: You are a specialised circuit-diagram interpreter. Given the image of an electrical circuit diagram, identify which symbol classes from the list below appear in the image. IMPORTANT RULES: - Only list symbols you can clearly see and identify in the image - Do not guess or assume symbols are present - If you're uncertain about a symbol, do not include it - Look for distinctive visual features of each symbol type - A typical simple circuit might only contain 2-5 different symbol types. List only the classes you find, in a python list, and nothing else. Symbol classes: ["terminal", "gnd", "vss", "voltage.dc", "voltage.ac", "voltage.battery", "resistor", "resistor.adjustable", "resistor.photo", "capacitor.unpolarized", "capacitor.polarized", "capacitor.adjustable", "inductor", "inductor.ferrite", "inductor.coupled", "transformer", "diode", "diode.light_emitting", "diode.thyrector", "diode.zener", "diac", "triac", "thyristor", "varistor", "transistor.bjt", "transistor.fet", "transistor.photo", "operational_amplifier", "operational_amplifier.schmitt_trigger", "optocoupler", "integrated_circuit", "integrated_circuit.ne555", "integrated_circuit.voltage_regulator", "xor", "and", "or", "not", "nand", "nor", "probe", "probe.current", "probe.voltage", "switch", "relay", "socket", "fuse", "speaker", "motor", "lamp", "microphone", "antenna", "crystal", "mechanical", "magnetic", "optical", "block"]

Human_Prompt: You are a specialised circuit-diagram interpreter performing zero-shot inference. Given the image of an electrical circuit diagram, identify all symbols of class "terminal". For each symbol from that class, output one <points> tag and nothing else, in the exact format: <points x1="…" y1="…" x2="…" y2="…" alt="terminal">terminal</points> Use the coordinates of the bounding polygon of each symbol. Do not include any additional text or tags.Example: <points x1="20.8" y1="42.4" x2="21.0" y2="53.6" alt="terminal">terminal</points>
